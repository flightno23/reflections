How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me the exact lines of code that have been changed. So that helps me keep track of the changes that I have made and introduced a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help me see the evolution of a program and will also be a place where code is saved and structured

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You get into the habit of commiting when there is some progress made in the project whereas if it were regularly done some of the commits wont be useful

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In programming, there are multiple files that are used and not only one file. So git allows multiple files to be saved in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it tells you the changes made to the project from the beginning

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you could always checkout a previous version once you break something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For all my side projects, which i am going to be uploading on GitHub
